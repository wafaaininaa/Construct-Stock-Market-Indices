# Construct-Stock-Market-Indices
## Personal project based on Coursera Project
I just join to Coursera Project about excel tools. The project name is Construct Stock Market Indices.
This project is taught about seeing the stock movements of 5 major companies in the United States. 
Those companies are known as FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google).
After learning from the project, I tried to make the same project with companies in Indonesia. 
I decided to try to see the stock movements of 5 companies classified as blue chips in Indonesia 
and see their movements from the beginning of January 2020 to the last day the stock market opened, April 16, 2021.
Data is collected using google finance on google spreadsheet.
I choosed BCA, BRI, Unilever, Telkom Indonesia, and Indofood.
Based on the graphic, stocks tumbled around the end of March, along with the soaring positive cases of the corona virus in Indonesia 
and the enactment of social restriction regulations.
Since the share price fell, it has slowly increased again.
